## What this is about

- Easy way ot manage layers of graphics (polyline, markers) for Google Maps, including Clustered layer
- higher level of capabilities to create markers with click callback, infowindow, draggable callback...
- manage/track zoom,center in localStorage
- conversion between {lat,lng} {latitude,longitude} and LatLng

## How to use

This requires the use of webpack for inclusion into front-end Web pages.

Have a look at:
- test.html for HTML page
- test.js for Javascript
- tes.wp.config.js for Webpack configuration

## More icons

Plenty of icons to chose from at https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.category=maps
